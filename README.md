In the coding bootcamp I did, we made a fullstack application and I used that as a template for making this introduction app. I used Python for the api routes and models because that is the language we used in bootcamp. I tried running the remote explorer but nothing showed. I'm not sure if this is functinal. My project in the bootcamp included an input submission element and that is what I referenced when building the input field in the front-end. I used JavaScript in the front-end because that is the language I am familiar with. Again, we went over that language extensivelly in the bootcamp. Thank you for reviewing my submission.
