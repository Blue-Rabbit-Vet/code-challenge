# Blue Rabbit Code Challenge

## Tech Used

### Front End

- React18
- AxiosJS

### Back End

- ExpressJS
- AWS-SDK
- Multer
- MySQL2
- Sequelize

## Installation Instructions

- Download project to your machine
- Create a `.env` file in the `server` folder and fill it out with the neccessary requirements. In this case I am using an AWS-S3 bucket for file uploading.
- In the project's root directory, open a terminal and run `npm install`. This will install dependencies for both client and server applications.
- To run the application in full, run `npm run develop`. This will use Concurrently to launch both the server and the front end client.
