# Explanations for libraries used
- Material UI for components such as Cards, Buttons, Input, etc.
- Node SASS for SASS Library, superset of CSS, SASS Loader for it to load it. I am more familiar with SASS than css so I replaced it.
- Next.js for production grade React. I just kinda like using Next, a server side rendering of React. Another reason is that i can easily deploy this project
- TypeScript, currently learning type, I am indifferent to using it over JavaScript. It's really good for catching run time error but it did slow me down a little.
- MockAPi, a cloud api storage service for me to host my api data. https://mockapi.io

## About
Runing this project should be simple. If you downloaded/clone/fork this project with all its files. I believe all you have to do is npm i, and to run it is npm run dev.

I did deploy it so you can click this link and see. https://bluevet.vercel.app/

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
