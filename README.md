# About this application
1.This is a Spring Boot + thymeleaf application built in MVC architecture. 

2.Since this is a small application, I used String to store data intead of creating a Model layer.

3.And since the requirement wasn't complicated, nothing was really chanllenging in this applcation. 

4.I am used to separate the front and back end development, but for the small application like this, I choose Spring Boot + thymeleaf, because Thymeleaf is a modern server-side rendered Java template engine, it integrated with back end very well. 

# How to run
1. download and unzip the application
2. open it in Intellij or STS
3. run the StartWebApplication class
4. open local host 8080 on your browser
