# Blue Rabbit Code Challenge

1. Create an API with an endpoint or operation that we can call that tells us your name. The shape of the data
   and the storage mechanism are up to you. It's ok if it takes no params and returns only your name.
2. Create a minimal frontend that calls your api and displays your name when we run it.
3. Add an API endpoint or operation that takes a name and stores it.
4. Add an input to the frontend that we can use to submit a name to the endpoint or operation you just created.
5. Add an input to the frontend that lets us upload an image avatar and submit it to your API.

This home assessment is very exciting for me.
In my career, I used React.js, and Node.js projects, so as the technical stack, I decided to use React.js, TypeScript, Redux Pattern, and Node.js. Anyway, I will do my best for 2 hours, and I will test how the level is my coding skill. Fighting.

# Install

1. `npm install` & `npm start` on server and client separately.
2. If server is running correctly, in initial time, name is `Nick Leo`.
3. Please type any name and select image file.
4. If you click `Upload Profile` button, they will post to server.
5. If Upload is okay, they will upgrade `My name`.
6. And you can check uploads directory in server for confirmation if file upload is working well.

# Develop Progress

It took 2 hours correctly.
My plan is to use React.js, TypeScript, Redux, Node.js.
But I didn't use Redux due to time limit.
In React.js, I used axios, React Hooks.
In Node.js, I used nodemon, cors, multer package.

It was very interesting time. Through this test, I realized my hands and brain is unfamiliar with some basic codebases and tools. Thank you so much!!!
